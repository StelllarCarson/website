         <img src="assets/game1.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Game Title One">
          <p>I still remember the story your a new traveler becoming a fossil fighter on vivosaur(dinosaur) island
           they start you out with basic gearr like a pickaxe,sonar,fossil bag all for digging up fossil bones 
           like the head or body sometimes feet or legs you excavate using the pickaxe and go back to the fossil center to clear the dirt 
           to bring the vivosaurs back to life then you train and make a team of 3 dinos and climb the ranks of the fossil fighters tournament 
           in 3v3 fights while also going around and digging up fossils this games a solid 10/10 gem in my books
